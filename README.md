# Writing your first Django app
The "Writing your first Django app" from the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) tutorial.<br>
It consists of the creation of a **basic poll application** with:
* A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
* An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

The first commit covers from Part 1 to Part 4.
